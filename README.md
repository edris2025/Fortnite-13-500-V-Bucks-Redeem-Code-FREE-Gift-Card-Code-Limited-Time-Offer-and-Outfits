## What Are V-Bucks in Fortnite?

Before we dive into the details of how you can claim your **FREE 13,500 V-Bucks** gift card, let’s quickly go over what V-Bucks are and why they are so important in Fortnite.

### What Are V-Bucks?

V-Bucks (short for Vindertech Bucks) are the in-game currency used in Fortnite to purchase various cosmetic items, battle passes, and exclusive content. Whether you want to deck out your character in the latest skins, unlock cool emotes, or level up your Battle Pass, V-Bucks are your ticket to enhancing your gaming experience.

Skins, gliders, harvesting tools, emotes, and more are all purchasable with V-Bucks, making them a must-have for serious Fortnite fans.
